## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I used motion library to animate the game. I learned how to use it and how to use it with react. I also learned how to use react hooks. especially useContex and useReducer. I also learned how to use react router.



### Continued development

I want to continue learning react and improve my skills, know more about state managment and how to use it in react. I also want to learn more about animations and how to use them in react.

### Useful resources

- [Motion.js](https://motion.dev/) - This helped me with animations. I really liked this library and will use it going forward.
